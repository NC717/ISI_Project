Olfaction is an important sense for insects including Drosophila melanogaster.
There are 66 Drosophila Olfactory Receptors (DORs) primary protein sequences
which are highly diverse. This article introduces a method for clustering these
66 DORs protein sequences based on image based similarity indices using math-
ematical morphology. Two dierent approaches are discussed- one is utilizing
naturally occurring twenty standard amino acids and another is chemical group-
ing of amino acids. A metric is dened in order to cluster the pair sequences
based on the similarity index and cluster the sequences into three classes - High-
est, Moderate and Lowest that best tted for 66 drosophila olfactory receptors
protein sequences. OR83b is the distinguished olfactory receptor expressed in
divergent insect population. Our investigation reconrms this quantitatively.
