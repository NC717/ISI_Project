# Ranking and clustering of Drosophila olfactory receptors using mathematical morphology [Link to the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088875431830154X)
Olfaction is an important sense for insects including Drosophila melanogaster. There are 66 Drosophila Olfactory Receptors (DORs) primary protein sequences which are highly diverse. This article introduces a method for clustering these 66 DORs protein sequences based on image based similarity indices using math-
ematical morphology. Two different approaches are discussed- one is utilizing naturally occurring twenty standard amino acids and another is chemical group-
ing of amino acids. A metric is defined in order to cluster the pair sequences based on the similarity index and cluster the sequences into three classes - High-
est, Moderate and Lowest that best suitted for 66 drosophila olfactory receptors protein sequences. OR83b is the distinguished olfactory receptor expressed in
divergent insect population. Our investigation reconfirms this quantitatively.
